## Overview

If you are like me, you' re documenting your learning journey and want the restriction-less freedom and growth that comes from recording your learnings and experiences.

I've tried multiple different editors and formats for documentation:

- Multiple Physical Notebooks
- Evernote
- Microsoft OneNote
- Notability (iPad)
- Emacs with Org-Roam
- Hugo
- Gatsby
- Notion
- LogSeq
- Capacity
- Google Keep
- Obsidian
- Quarto

From trial and error and with working as a programmer; a former collegue introduced me to Doom Emacs and Org Roam. From there, I tried out other knowledge-based systems and the [[Zettelkasten]] method from these two videos using Emacs and Org Mode (Transformative Videos!)

- [Literate Documentation with Emacs and Org Mode](https://www.youtube.com/@elspuddo) #literate-programming
- [Consistent Technical Documents Using Emacs and Org Mode](https://www.youtube.com/@elspuddo) #literate-programming
- [Org-mode, literate programming in Emacs](https://www.youtube.com/@niklaseklund2522) #literate-programming

From using both Notion, Capacities and other systems and subscription services for media consumption, I've come to the realization that all you consume, create and do should ideally be owned and managed by yourself. Startups and companies change, policies and financial incentives likewise. There is no telling that your personal notes and knowledge will remain six months from now, let alone 6 years! What if they decide to change the financial plans? Is deprecated or sold (As in the case of many Google or Microsoft products)? The list goes on

In my case, I noticed that Notion became increasingly slow and hard to manage, navigate and style. It forced me to think more about the visual appeal and organization of notes; working around the limitations of Notion.

I did not want to be limited in terms of collecting distinct and diverse thoughts and ideas - I just wanted to take notes! To make them quickly, without worry of structure or risk of not finding them, also ensuring that they are always available and in a format that any editor or browser can display (Markdown). My previous experiment with Emacs and Org-mode had been wonderful, but the `.org` file format felt restrictive. Not many platforms supported the format. To write in the format, I almost had to use Emacs. Not ideal. So, I decided on Markdown (`.md`) instead

I'd heard much about the book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes), [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book) and decided after reading them to base my note-taking system on plain text notes organized loosely based on the [[Zettelkasten]] method. Out of the programs I tested, Obsidian has so far been the best for me. Simple, good defaults, easy to use and introduce to new people. It looks great and supports plugins, which makes it easy to introduce it to new people.

On the nerdier side, having notes as plain text means:

- Easy to export to other formats
- Trivial to store in version control (Dropbox, Google Drive, Git)
- Can be opened in most editors and browsers
- Option move to other formats and be copied to others
- Possibility to encrypt notes, use them in code projects for technical documentation, mailing them, and blogs. More on the later in a bit (see [[Publishing Obsidian Notes as a Website]])

Finally, as a programmer, I'm often jumping between projects, taking notes about projects, documenting technical specifications, function, issues and more. Notes and learnings should be possible to edit in any editor. In a future post, I hope to expand on how interactive programming and exploration someone might be used to in Jupyter Notebooks is also possible with a plain-text format. More on that later
